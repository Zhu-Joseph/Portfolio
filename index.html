        <h2> About Joseph </h2>
        <img src = "images/ucla-whey.jpg" alt = "UCLA" />
        <p> <!--         link image of UCLA & Whey -->
          I graduated from UCLA in 2016 with a career lined up as a tax accountant. However, while working in tax, I began to notice how having vital software was. 
          It could save one's day with the auto save or ruin it by not working properly. 
          Knowing how to use the software was important, but knowing how to improve or build your own would set you apart.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, my interest in software engineering out weighed my interest in tax accounting. 
          Learning how to create applications and putting websites together simply felt more rewarding. 
          This led me to take a leap of faith by joining Thinkful to further my knowledge. 
          Now, although my journey has just begun, I am excited to see where it will bring me.
        </p>

          If you're looking for a new developer or a partner for a hackathon, please reach out! 
          I am excited to work with and learn from other developers. 
          Together we will build great software.
